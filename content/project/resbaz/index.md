Te Kura o te Kauri is an education/outreach project aimed at children, their whānau, and communities. 

​Our project teaches children about the science and mātauranga of the ngahere. We use sensory experiences to connect children with science and the natural world, to encourage their natural curiosity and to set them on the path to a lifelong interest in kaitiakitanga (guardianship of their environment).

Our project brings impactful engagement, research-grade equipment and technology, and world-class expertise to communities in Te Tai Tokerau.
